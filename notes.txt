First, you create your branch locally:
       (git checkout -b <branch-name> # Create a new branch and check it out)
The remote branch is automatically created when you push it to the remote server. So when you feel ready for it, you can just do:
         (git push <remote-name> <branch-name> )
->git checkout -b mybranch(to switch to another branch)
->git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>(to delete branch e.g git push origin --delete mynewbranch)
-> git checkout master(switch back to master branch)
->git branch -a (to list all remote branches)
